#RAT Notes Documentation
##Overview
The source for RAT Notes documentation is here under ``sources/`` in the
form of .rst files. These files use
[reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html)
formatting with [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) extensions for
structure, cross-linking and indexing.

The HTML files are built and hosted on
[readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ratnotes/). The HTML files update
automatically after each change to the master or release branch of the
[RAT Notes files on GitHub](https://github.com/iraycd/rat-notes) thanks to
post-commit hooks. The "release" branch maps to the "latest"
documentation and the "master" branch maps to the "master"
documentation. 

**Warning**: The "master" documentation may include features not yet
part of any official RAT notes release. "Master" docs should be used only
for understanding bleeding-edge development and "latest" should be
used for the latest official release.
